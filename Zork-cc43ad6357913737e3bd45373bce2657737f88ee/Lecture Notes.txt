- USE GROUP BOXES
- Do not have the form named as anythig likle "Form1" (default form name in visual studio)
- In general, get in the practice of renaming components of the GUI (Just as you would in Unity)
- Short cuts can be added via the "Properties" menu in VS and any shortcuts added to menu strip items will actually show up on the form (i.e.: "File -> New     CTRL + N")
- Keep an eye on generated members for menu assets (they can be disabled / made false via the properties window)
- Make use of pipe seperated lists when using the open file dialogue item
- Get the addon "ProperyChanged.Fody" for the inventory manager project
- MessageBox.Show("Not yet implemented"); is useful for features that can be interacted with but do not have any content


- Use these components:
	- Menu Strip
	- Open File Dialogue
	- Button
	- Binding Source 
		- (Player's tab should only have one binding source)
		- 
	- Text box
	- Numeric Up/Down
